# E2E Testing in Angular with CucumberJS

This repository is a copy of Angular's Tour of Heros sample application. My goal was to take the e2e tests written using Jasmine and replace them with e2e tests written with CucumberJS.

## Branches

* [master](https://github.com/dkellycollins/angular-cucumber-e2e) - This branch contians the Tour of Heros application with no modifications to the tests.
* [cucumber](https://github.com/dkellycollins/angular-cucumber-e2e/tree/cucumber) - This branch is where the e2e tests a rewritten using CucumberJS.

## Running the tests

In order to run the tests on any branch, just run `npm run e2e` in your terminal.
